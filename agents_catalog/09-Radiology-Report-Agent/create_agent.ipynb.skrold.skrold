    "## An agent to validate radiology report based on ACR guidelines\n",
    "The American College of Radiology (ACR), as the leading professional organization for radiologists, has established comprehensive guidelines for standardized radiology reporting to ensure diagnostic accuracy and patient care quality. In many healthcare settings, the current workflow requires senior radiologists to review and validate reports generated by junior colleaguesâ€”a critical but time-intensive process that creates bottlenecks in medical imaging departments already struggling with high workloads. To streamline this process while maintaining quality standards, Amazon NOVA's advanced multimodal AI capabilities can be leveraged to automatically evaluate radiology reports against ACR's established criteria, providing real-time feedback and guidance. This AI-assisted solution can instantly identify missing elements, suggest improvements based on ACR guidelines, and help junior radiologists generate more accurate and complete reports, ultimately reducing the review burden on senior radiologists while maintaining high reporting standards."

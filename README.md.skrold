# Sample Healthcare and Life Sciences Agents on AWS

## Project Components

### Agents catalog

Library of specialized agents for common workflows across drug research, clinical trials, and commercialization [agent-catalog](agents_catalog/)

### Multi-agent collaboration

Framework for agent collaboration and knowledge sharing. End to end examples for cancer biomarker discovery, clinical trial protocol assistant, and competitive intelligence. [multi-agent-collaboration](multi_agent_collaboration/)

### Evaluation

Methods for assessing agent performance and result quality. Agent task and goal metrics for cancer biomarker discovery [evaluations](evaluations/)

The key components are illustrated in the diagram below:

## Prerequisites

Please complete the following steps in your AWS account before deployment.

### 1. Request Amazon Bedrock model access

Request access to the following Amazon Bedrock foundation models using the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html).

- Amazon Titan Embeddings G1 - Text
- Amazon Nova Pro
- Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2
- Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet

### 2. Request service quota increase

[Request an increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html#quota-console-increase) of the Amazon Bedrock "Parameters per function" quota to at least 10.

## Deployment

Choose _Launch Stack_ for your preferred region to deploy the toolkit application and selected agents into your AWS account. It may take up to 30 minutes to finish the deployment.

| Name | ap-northeast-1  | ap-northeast-1  |
| -- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| All resources | [![launch-stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=ap-northeast-1 #/stacks/new?stackName=hcls-agent-toolkit&templateURL=https://5d1a4b76751b4c8a994ce96bafd91ec9-ap-northeast-1 .s3.ap-northeast-1 .amazonaws.com/public_assets_support_materials/hcls_agents_toolkit/Infra_cfn.yaml) | [![launch-stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=ap-northeast-1 #/stacks/new?stackName=hcls-agent-toolkit&templateURL=https://5d1a4b76751b4c8a994ce96bafd91ec9-ap-northeast-1 .s3.ap-northeast-1 .amazonaws.com/public_assets_support_materials/hcls_agents_toolkit/Infra_cfn.yaml) |

This will deploy the following agents:

- Cancer Biomarker Discovery (Multi-Agent Supervisor)
- Biomarker Database Analyst
- Clinical Evidence Researcher
- Medical Imaging Expert
- Statistician
- Clinical Trial Protocol Assistant (Multi-Agent Supervisor)
- Clinical Study Research Agent
- Clinical Trial Protocol Generator Agent
- Wiley Open Access Life Sciences Agent
- UniProt Protein Search Agent
- Competitive Intelligence (Multi-Agent Supervisor)
- SEC 10-K Search Agent
- Tavily Web Search Agent
- USPTO Search Agent

In most cases, you may leave the default template parameters unchanged. However, several parameters require new values:

- **ReactAppAllowedCidr**: CIDR range from where access to the React UI is allowed. Learn about best practices in the [AWS VPC documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cidr/). To restrict React App UI access to just your IP, first find your IP address through public websites such as [WhatIsMyIpAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) and suffix it with 32. For example, if your ip adress is `192.0.2.0` the minimal CIDR range would be `192.0.2.0/32`.

- **RedshiftPassword**: Password for Redshift database login. Remember and store password securely. Must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number. Only printable ASCII characters, spaces, and the `/`, `@`, `"`, and `'` values may be used.

- [Optional] **TavilyApiKey**: API key for the Tavily web search API. Required to deploy the Tavily Web Search and Competitive Intelligence Supervisor agents. Please visit [tavily.com](https://tavily.com/) to create a account and generate an API key.
- [Optional] **USPTOApiKey**: API key for the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Open Data Portal. Required to deploy the USPTO Search and Competitive Intelligence Supervisor agents. Please visit the [USPO Open Data Portal](https://data.uspto.gov/apis/getting-started) to create a account and generate an API key.
- [Optional] **ExistingVpcId**: To use an existing VPC to host the ReactApp, provide the VPC Id here. If you do not provide it will will create a new VPC and required public and private subnets
- [Optional] **ExistingPublicSubnets**:  To use existing public subnets in an existing VPC to host the ReactApp, provide 2 Public Subnet Ids here (In 2 separate availability zones). If you do not provide it will will create a new VPC and required public and private subnets.
- [Optional] **ExistingPrivateSubnets**:  To use existing private subnets in an existing VPC for VPC based resources, provide 2 Private Subnet Ids here (In 2 separate availability zones). If you do not provide it will will create a new VPC and required public and private subnets.

You may also deploy the application using the AWS CLI by first running `aws cloudformation package` and then `aws cloudformation deploy`. For example:

```sh
set -xe

export BUCKET_NAME="amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
export REGION="ap-northeast-1 "
export STACK_NAME="hcls-agents-toolkit"
export TAVILY_API_KEY="1234567890abcdef0"
export USPTO_API_KEY="1234567890abcdef0"
aws cloudformation package --template-file "infra_cfn.yaml" \
  --s3-bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
  --output-template-file "packaged_infra_cfn.yaml" \
  --region $REGION
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file "packaged_infra_cfn.yaml" \
  --s3-bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --stack-name $STACK_NAME \
  --region $REGION \
  --disable-rollback \
  --parameter-overrides \
    RedshiftPassword="MyExamplePassword123$$" \
    ReactAppAllowedCidr="192.0.2.0/24" \
    TavilyApiKey=$TAVILY_API_KEY \
    USPTOApiKey=$USPTO_API_KEY
rm packaged_infra_cfn.yaml

```
> [!Note]
> To use existing VPC and subnets, provide them as additional arguments in the `--parameter-overrides` section above. For example:
  >  
  > --parameter-overrides ExistingVpcId="vpc-i767asdfg8ase87f6" ExistingPublicSubnets=subnet-9867zdf897sa6fe,subnet-7896sadf786sdf ExistingPrivateSubnets=subnet-87d6cv78s6df,subnet-87s6df786asdf78

## Access the toolkit application

1. Navigate to AWS CloudFormation via AWS Console search
2. Click the parent stack name that was chosen to deploy the `Infra_cfn.yaml`
3. In the Outputs tab, find the `ReactAppExternalURL` link and add 'http://' to the beginning of the URL and paste in your browser
4. You should be able to see a landing page with all (or a subset) deployed agents as shown in the [video](https://d2dnsxs0d2upyb.cloudfront.net/agents-demo/agents_toolkit_overview.mp4) below:

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The [Tavily web search](agents_catalog/11-Tavily-web-search-agent/README.md) and [USPTO search](agents_catalog/14-USPTO-search/README.md) tools can be added to your MCP client of choice using the [AWS Lambda MCP Server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/lambda-mcp-server/). After installing one of both of them, you can add them to your MCP client configuration:

```json
"hcls-agents": {
   "args": ["awslabs.lambda-mcp-server"],
   "env": {
         "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "<YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY ID>",
         "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "<YOUR AWS SECRET ACCESS KEY>",
         "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN":"<YOUR AWS SESSION TOKEN>",
         "AWS_REGION": "YOUR AWS REGION",
         "FUNCTION_TAG_KEY": "Application",
         "FUNCTION_TAG_VALUE": "HCLSAgents",
   },
   "command": "uvx"
}
```

Depending on your local environment, you may need to provide the full path to your `uvx` executable. View the [installation instructions](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/lambda-mcp-server/#installation) for more ways to provide AWS credentials to the tools.

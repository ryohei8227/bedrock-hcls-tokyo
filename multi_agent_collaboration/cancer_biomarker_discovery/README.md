## Overview
The success rate for Phase I oncology clinical trials is significantly low. According to a study published in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, the overall success rate for oncology drugs from Phase I to approval is around 5%, indicating a high failure rate of approximately 95%. 

According to the National Cancer Institute, cancer biomarkers, also known as tumor markers, are biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that indicate the presence of cancer.  Biomarkers for patient stratification can improve the probability of success in clinical development; the average is between double and triple, but it can be as high as five-fold. 

In this solution, we show you how agentic workflows with LLMs from Amazon Bedrock leverage planning, tool-use, and self-reflection to transform complex oncology research queries into actionable insights. We define an example analysis pipeline, specifically for lung cancer survival with clinical, genomics and radiology modalities of biomarkers. We showcase a variety of tools including database retrieval with Text2SQL, statistical models and visual charts with scientific libraries, biomedical literature search with public APIs and internal evidence, and medical image processing with Amazon SageMaker jobs. We demonstrate advanced capabilities of agents for self-review and planning that help build trust with end users by breaking down complex tasks into a series of question and answers and showing the chain of thought to generate the final answer.

## Biomarker analysis workflow
The biomarker analysis workflow is illustrated below that incorporates multimodal data, including clinical, genomic, and CT scan imaging data. We augment this pipeline with Agents for Amazon Bedrock.

Amazon Bedrock enables generative AI applications to execute multistep tasks across company systems and data sources. We define our solution to include planning and reasoning with multiple agents. 

    Biomarker database analyst : Convert natural language questions to SQL statements and execute on an Amazon Redshift database of biomarkers.
    Statistician: Use a custom container with lifelines library to build survival regression models and visualization such as Kaplan Meier charts for survival analysis.
    Clinical evidence researcher: Use PubMed APIs to search biomedical literature for external evidence. Use Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver responses from internal literature evidence.
    Medical imaging expert: Use Amazon SageMaker jobs to augment agents with the capability to trigger asynchronous jobs with an ephemeral cluster to process CT scan images.

### What Does the Input Data Look Like?
We reuse the multimodal data analysis pipeline from this solution(https://github.com/aws-samples/machine-learning-pipelines-for-multimodal-health-data/tree/sagemaker-soln-lcsp) for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 
The [Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Radiogenomics dataset](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/NSCLC+Radiogenomics) consists a cohort of early stage NSCLC patients referred for surgical treatment. Prior to surgical procedures, Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography/CT (PET/CT) are performed. Samples of tumor tissues were used to obtain mutation data and gene expresssion data by RNA sequencing technology. Clinical and demographic information were recorded for the patients as well. Each data modality (imaging, genomic, clincal) presents different view of a patient.

Details for each modality is described below.

#### Genomic 
Total RNA was extracted from the tumor tissue and analyzed with RNA sequencing technology. 
The dataset file that is available from the source was pre-processed using open-source tools including STAR v.2.3 for alignment and Cufflinks v.2.0.2 for expression calls. Further details can be found in [3]. The original dataset (GSE103584_R01_NSCLC_RNAseq.txt.gz) is also available in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE103584.

While the original data contains more than 22,000 genes, we keep 21 genes from 10 highly coexpressed gene clusters (metagenes) that were identified, validated in publicly available gene-expression cohorts, and correlated with prognosis [3]. These are genes corresponding to Metagenes 19, 10, 9, 4, 3, 21 in Table 2 in [3]. 

After gene selection from the source data, the dataset looks like

| Case_ID   |    LRIG1 |    HPGD |     GDF15 |    CDH2 |    POSTN |  ......  |
|:----------|---------:|--------:|----------:|--------:|---------:|---------:|
| R01-024   | 26.7037  | 3.12635 | 13.0269   | 0       | 36.4332  |  ......  |
| R01-153   | 15.2133  | 5.0693  |  0.908663 | 0       | 32.8595  |  ......  |
| R01-031   |  5.54082 | 1.23083 | 29.8832   | 1.13549 | 34.8544  |  ......  |
| R01-032   | 12.8391  | 7.21931 | 12.0701   | 0       |  7.77297 |  ......  |
| R01-033   | 33.7975  | 3.19058 |  5.43418  | 0       |  9.84029 |  ......  |

The values denote expression level for each gene per patient. A higher number means that that specific gene is highly expressed in that specific tumor sample.

#### Clinical record
The clinical records are stored in CSV format. Each row corresponds to a patient and the columns represent information about the patients, including demographics, tumor stage, and survival status. 

| Case ID   | Survival Status   |  Age at Histological Diagnosis | Weight (lbs)   | Smoking status   | Pack Years    |   Quit Smoking Year | Chemotherapy   | Adjuvant Treatment   | EGFR mutation status   |  ......  |

#### Medical imaging
Medical imaging biomarkers of cancer promise improvements in patient care through advances in precision medicine. Compared to genomic biomarkers, imaging biomarkers provide the advantages of being non-invasive, and characterizing a heterogeneous tumor in its entirety, as opposed to limited tissue available via biopsy [2]. In this dataset, CT and PET/CT imaging sequences were acquired for patients prior to surgical procedures. Segmentation of tumor regions were annotated by two expert thoracic radiologists. Below is an example overlay of a tumor segmentation onto a lung CT scan (case R01-093).

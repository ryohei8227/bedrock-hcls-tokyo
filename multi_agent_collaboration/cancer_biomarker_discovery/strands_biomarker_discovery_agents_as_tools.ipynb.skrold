      "- **Squamous NSCLC**: While less common in this subtype, EGFR mutations were detected in 7.9% of never-smokers with squamous NSCLC compared to 0.4% in ever-smokers [3]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Most Common EGFR Mutation Types\n",
      "- **Exon 19 deletions**: ~46.3% of EGFR mutations\n",
      "- **L858R point mutation in exon 21**: ~39.0% of EGFR mutations\n",
      "- **Exon 20 insertions**: Less common (2.44% of all NSCLC cases) but clinically significant [4]\n",
      "- **T790M**: Secondary resistance mutation occurring in ~50-60% of patients who progress on first/second-generation EGFR-TKIs\n",

      "  - Female patients\n",
      "  - Never-smokers or light smokers\n",
      "  - Asian ethnicity\n",
      "  - Adenocarcinoma histology (especially lepidic and acinar predominant patterns)\n",
      "  - Earlier disease stages [2]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Value\n",
      "- **Survival benefit**: EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients treated with targeted therapies show significantly longer survival compared to standard chemotherapy (p=0.027) [1]\n",
      "- **Response prediction**: Higher allele frequency of EGFR mutations in plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is associated with poorer prognosis in patients treated with osimertinib [5]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Value\n",
      "- **Treatment response**: EGFR mutations are strong predictors of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)\n",
      "- **Mutation subtype impact**: Different mutations confer varying sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs:\n",
      "  - Exon 19 deletions and L858R mutations are most sensitive\n",
      "  - Exon 20 insertions are generally more resistant to standard EGFR-TKIs [4]\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Treatment Implications\n",
      "\n",
      "### First-line Treatment\n",
      "- **Standard of care**: EGFR-TKIs are first-line therapy for advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC\n",
      "- **Generations of EGFR-TKIs**:\n",
      "  - First-generation (erlotinib, gefitinib)\n",
      "  - Second-generation (afatinib, dacomitinib)\n",
      "  - Third-generation (osimertinib)\n",
      "- **Combination therapies**: Osimertinib plus bevacizumab showed promising results with 76% progression-free survival at 12 months and median PFS of 19 months [6]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Resistance Mechanisms\n",
      "- **T790M mutation**: Primary mechanism of resistance to first/second-generation EGFR-TKIs\n",
      "- **Secondary resistance to osimertinib**:\n",
      "  - C797S mutation (most common, found in 24.7% of resistant cases)\n",
      "  - L792 mutations (10.8%)\n",
      "  - L718/G719 mutations (9.7%) [7]\n",
      "  - Other mechanisms: MET amplification, KRAS mutations, PIK3CA mutations\n",
      "  - Histological transformations (squamous cell, pleomorphic) [6]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Novel Treatment Approaches\n",
      "- **Exon 20 insertion-specific therapies**:\n",
      "  - High-dose furmonertinib (240mg/day) shows promising efficacy in EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations with 52.4% objective response rate and 100% disease control rate [4]\n",
      "  - Lazertinib demonstrates efficacy in T790M-positive NSCLC and superior blood-brain barrier penetration [8]\n",
      "- **Re-challenge strategies**: Re-administration of osimertinib after acquired resistance showed modest activity (33% objective response rate) with tolerable toxicity [9]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Molecular Testing Implications\n",
      "- **Comprehensive molecular profiling**: Recommended for all patients with advanced NSCLC, including both adenocarcinoma and squamous histologies in never-smokers [3]\n",
      "- **Liquid biopsy utility**: Plasma ctDNA testing for EGFR mutations has clinical value in monitoring treatment response and detecting resistance mechanisms [5]\n",
      "- **Epigenetic factors**: M6A methylation regulators METTL3 and ALKBH5 are upregulated in EGFR-mutant NSCLC and correlate with poorer prognosis [10]\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Future Directions\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Combination approaches**: Targeting parallel pathways to overcome resistance\n",
      "- **Novel biomarkers**: Identifying additional biomarkers (e.g., PRDX1) that may affect EGFR-TKI sensitivity [11]\n",
      "- **Fourth-generation TKIs**: Development of inhibitors effective against C797S and other resistance mutations\n",
      "- **Personalized treatment algorithms**: Based on specific mutation subtypes and co-mutations\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "EGFR mutations serve as critical biomarkers in lung cancer, guiding treatment selection and predicting outcomes. Their prevalence varies by population demographics, with higher rates in Asian populations, females, and never-smokers. While EGFR-targeted therapies have revolutionized treatment for patients with these mutations, resistance remains a significant challenge, necessitating ongoing development of novel therapeutic strategies and comprehensive molecular testing.\n",

      "## Clinical Implications\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tumor Size**: Patient R01-040 has a significantly larger tumor by all measures (volume, diameter, surface area), which may indicate a more advanced stage of disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Tumor Density**: The tumor in R01-040 is considerably denser (-98.28 HU vs -438.38 HU), which could reflect differences in tissue composition (more solid components) and potentially higher metabolic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Tumor Heterogeneity**: Although R01-083's tumor shows higher entropy (5.15 vs 4.57), R01-040's tumor demonstrates more complex patterns (NGTDM Complexity: 4,799.70 vs 3,532.00) and a wider range of density values, suggesting intricate internal architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Texture Analysis**: The different textural features suggest distinct biological characteristics between the two tumors, with R01-040 potentially having more varied tissue components despite its larger size.\n",
      "\n",
